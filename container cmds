ML2 networking model:
Cisco ACI OpenStack plug-in leverages Cisco APIC to implement OpenStack tenant networking and security services. To
do so, it maps Neutron concepts such as networks, subnets, and routers to Cisco ACI concepts such as EPGs, bridge
domains and contracts.

project  --> tenant + VRF
network --> epg + bd
subnet --> subnet
Router --> contract (consumed and provided by networks connected to the neutron network)
(Contract is defined with a filter to allow any IP traffic.
Policy enforcement is configured with security groups.)

security groups --> host protection policies
(It is implemented as stateful firewall rules in OVS.)

All the BD and EPG corresponding to each neutron network in a project is associated with
the VRF created when a project is created. 

GBP networking model:
GBP model of openstack provides an intent-driven declarative policy model
that aims to abstract application segmentation from  networking layer.

GBP abstractions of openstack is closely aligned with declarative policy model used in Cisco Apic.

project --> tenant and application profile
L3 policy --> VRF
L2 policy --> BD and associated subnet
policy group --> EPG
policy ruleset --> contracts (implemented as stateful firewall rules in OVS)

gbp offers policy api through multiple openstack interfaces:
1. openstack-dashboard-gbp
2. openstack-heat-gbp
3. openstack-neutron-gbp

These interfaces are installed with cisco aci plug-in. 
GBP was designed to act as a layer on top of neutron. 

While it is possible to use OpenStack security groups as in the ML2 model, 
with GBP you can also control Cisco ACI contracts and provide or consume those by policy groups.

GBP Policy Rulesets are enforced on the OpenStack nodes as OpenFlow rules programmed on OVS (when using OpFlexovs), 
but also on the Cisco ACI leaf switches as if they were standard Cisco ACI contracts

policy target --> Policy target is an individual network endpoint (generally a
NIC). In other words, this is a basic addressable unit in the
architecture.

policy group -->  
1. Policy targets with the same properties are organized into policy groups.
2. A policy group is the fundamental primitive of GBP. 
3. Policy groups offer an infrastructure-agnostic grouping construct without specifying any network semantics in the same way as a broadcast
4. Each group models its dependencies by declaring the rule sets that it provides to groups as well as rule sets that it consumes.

policy classifier --> 
A means of filtering network traffic, including protocol, port range, and direction (in, out, or bidirectional). 

policy action -->
Action to be taken when a rule is applied. (allow ,redirect)

Policy rules --> classifiers paired with actions

policy rule set --> contains several policy rules. Can be nested via parent-child relationship.







OpenStack administrator could define a subset of OpenStack projects using the ML2 Neutron model, and another set of
projects using the GBP model. A single project should not mix ML2 and GBP configurations.



APIC Integration Database and APIC Integration
Manager (AIM) introduced as central point of
storing plugin configuration.
• AIM uses the OpenStack database.
• AIM continuously synchronizes with APIC using
APIC Integration Daemon (AID).
• Group-Based Policies are mapped into Neutron API
and then AIM. Neutron APIs are mapped to AIM
directly.
